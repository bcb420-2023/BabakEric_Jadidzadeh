abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.}

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique
               to help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the
               results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds
               functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are
               statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally,
               the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes
               in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the
               increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many
               current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal.
               PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in
               the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed
               ``Enrichment Map'', a network-based visualization method for
               gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a
               network, where each set is a node and edges represent gene
               overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups related
               gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly
               identify the major enriched functional themes and more easily
               interpret the enrichment results. CONCLUSIONS: Enrichment Map is
               a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment
               analysis. Any research project that generates a list of genes
               can take advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment
               Map is implemented as a freely available and user friendly
               plug-in for the Cytoscape network visualization software
               (http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap/).",

               experiments. This method identifies biological pathways that are
               enriched in a gene list more than would be expected by chance.
               We explain the procedures of pathway enrichment analysis and
               present a practical step-by-step guide to help interpret gene
               lists resulting from RNA-seq and genome-sequencing experiments.
               The protocol comprises three major steps: definition of a gene
               list from omics data, determination of statistically enriched
               pathways, and visualization and interpretation of the results.
               We describe how to use this protocol with published examples of
               differentially expressed genes and mutated cancer genes;
               however, the principles can be applied to diverse types of omics
               data. The protocol describes innovative visualization
               techniques, provides comprehensive background and
               troubleshooting guidelines, and uses freely available and
               frequently updated software, including g:Profiler, Gene Set
               Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), Cytoscape and EnrichmentMap. The
               complete protocol can be performed in ~4.5 h and is designed for

               in patients. We investigated the effect of supernatants from 25

               profound inhibition of proliferation, cytokine secretion and
               cytotoxic activity was seen when T-cells were cultured in
               concentrated tumor supernatants from 6 cell lines fractionated
               into high (>100 kDa) m.w. molecules. Interestingly, the
               inhibitory effects were reversed when the tumor supernatant was
               removed. Cell cycle studies of inhibited T-cells showed most of
               them were growth arrested in the G(0)/G(1) phase similar to
               na{\"\i}ve T-cells. In addition, these T-cells did not express
               IL2-receptors and expression of CD54 (ICAM-1) and CD58 (LFA-3)
               resembled that of resting T-cells. Protein gel electrophoresis
               of the tumor supernatants and western blot analysis demonstrated
               the presence of soluble MUC1 in the inhibitory tumor

               depletion of soluble MUC1 by immunoprecipitation from the tumor
               supernatants neutralized the inhibitory effects on
               T-lymphocytes. Therefore, our results show that MUC1 shed by
               cultured epithelial tumor cells mediates inhibition of T-cell
